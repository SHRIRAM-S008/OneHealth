## Database Changes Required

To complete the public access setup, you need to run SQL commands to either:

1. Disable Row Level Security on all tables (recommended)
2. Create permissive policies that allow public access

See [scripts/README-PUBLIC-ACCESS.md](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/scripts/README-PUBLIC-ACCESS.md) for the specific SQL commands.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, you should be able to:

1. Access all pages without logging in
2. View all disease cases, outbreaks, and alerts
3. Upload CSV files without authentication
4. Create new cases through the API without authentication

## Security Warning

⚠️ **Warning**: These changes make all data in your system publicly accessible. Only implement these changes in a development or demonstration environment. For production use, implement proper authentication and authorization controls.
