# Runtime Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **"window is not defined" error**: Occurred because Leaflet was being imported directly during server-side rendering
2. **"Map has no maxZoom specified" error**: Missing maxZoom property in MapContainer component

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Compatibility
- **Dynamic imports**: Moved all Leaflet-related imports to dynamic imports with `ssr: false` to prevent execution during SSR
- **Conditional loading**: Added `typeof window !== "undefined"` checks before using Leaflet APIs
- **Deferred initialization**: Marker cluster group creation now happens only in useEffect hooks after component mount

### 2. Map Configuration
- **Added maxZoom property**: Set `maxZoom={18}` in MapContainer component to prevent zoom errors
- **Proper type handling**: Updated type definitions to work with dynamic imports

### 3. Code Changes in [components/dashboard/cases-map.tsx](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/components/dashboard/cases-map.tsx)

#### Before (problematic):
```typescript
import L from "leaflet"
import "leaflet.markercluster"
```

#### After (fixed):
```typescript
// Dynamically import Leaflet and marker cluster to avoid SSR issues
let L: any
let markerClusterGroup: any

if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  L = require("leaflet")
  require("leaflet.markercluster")
  
  // Fix for default marker icons in Leaflet with Next.js
  delete (L.Icon.Default.prototype as any)._getIconUrl
  L.Icon.Default.mergeOptions({
    iconRetinaUrl: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.7.1/images/marker-icon-2x.png",
    iconUrl: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.7.1/images/marker-icon.png",
    shadowUrl: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/1.7.1/images/marker-shadow.png",
  })
  
  markerClusterGroup = (L as any).markerClusterGroup
}
```

#### Before (missing maxZoom):
```typescript
<MapContainer
  center={getMapCenter()}
  zoom={4}
  style={{ height: "100%", width: "100%" }}
  ref={setMap as unknown as Dispatch<SetStateAction<any>>}
>
```

#### After (with maxZoom):
```typescript
<MapContainer
  center={getMapCenter()}
  zoom={4}
  maxZoom={18}
  style={{ height: "100%", width: "100%" }}
  ref={setMap as unknown as Dispatch<SetStateAction<any>>}
>
```

### 4. Additional Improvements
- **Enhanced useEffect dependencies**: Added proper cleanup functions for all event listeners and resources
- **Type safety**: Improved type definitions for map-related variables
- **Error prevention**: Added conditional checks before calling Leaflet methods

## Verification
- Application now starts without runtime errors
- Map component loads correctly in browser
- All interactive features work as expected:
  - Interactive markers with popups
  - Cluster visualization
  - Region filtering by drawing rectangles
  - Toggle controls for different visualization options

## Testing
The fixes have been verified by:
1. Successful build process
2. Clean startup of development server
3. Proper rendering of map component in browser
4. Functional interactive features

These changes ensure full compatibility with Next.js server-side rendering while maintaining all the enhanced map functionality.
