# Hydration Error Fixes Summary

## Issue
React hydration error occurred because the server-rendered HTML didn't match the client-rendered HTML. This was caused by conditional rendering based on `typeof window !== 'undefined'` which creates a mismatch between server and client.

## Root Causes
1. **Conditional rendering**: Using `typeof window !== 'undefined'` directly in the render function
2. **Duplicate markers**: Rendering markers both in the MapContainer and in a separate LayerGroup
3. **Improper SSR handling**: Leaflet libraries being initialized during server rendering

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Client-Only Initialization Pattern
- **useState hook**: Added `isClient` state to track client-side execution
- **useEffect hook**: Moved all Leaflet initialization to client-side only
- **Conditional rendering**: Replaced direct `typeof window` checks with `isClient` state

### 2. Code Changes in [components/dashboard/cases-map.tsx](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/components/dashboard/cases-map.tsx)

#### Before (problematic):
```typescript
{typeof window !== 'undefined' ? (
  <MapContainer ...>
    {/* Markers rendered here */}
    {showClusters && !map && (
      <LayerGroup>
        {/* Duplicate markers rendered here */}
      </LayerGroup>
    )}
  </MapContainer>
) : (
  <div>Loading map...</div>
)}
```

#### After (fixed):
```typescript
// Initialize client-side only
useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true)
  // ... Leaflet initialization
}, [])

// In render function:
{isClient ? (
  <MapContainer ...>
    {/* No duplicate markers */}
  </MapContainer>
) : (
  <div>Loading map...</div>
)}
```

### 3. Leaflet Library Management
- **Deferred loading**: Moved Leaflet imports to useEffect hooks
- **Global storage**: Stored markerClusterGroup reference on window object
- **Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup functions for all resources

### 4. Removed Duplicate Markers
- **Simplified rendering**: Removed the duplicate LayerGroup with markers
- **Single source of truth**: Markers are now managed exclusively by the marker cluster

### 5. Enhanced useEffect Dependencies
- **Added isClient dependency**: All useEffect hooks that depend on client-side features now include `isClient` in their dependency array
- **Proper cleanup**: Added cleanup functions for all event listeners and resources

## Verification
- Application starts without hydration errors
- Map component loads correctly in browser
- All interactive features work as expected:
  - Interactive markers with popups
  - Cluster visualization
  - Region filtering by drawing rectangles
  - Toggle controls for different visualization options

## Testing
The fixes have been verified by:
1. Successful build process
2. Clean startup of development server
3. No hydration errors in browser console
4. Proper rendering of map component
5. Functional interactive features

These changes ensure proper React hydration while maintaining all the enhanced map functionality.
