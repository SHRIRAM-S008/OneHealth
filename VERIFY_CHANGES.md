# Verify Public Access Changes

This document provides a checklist to verify that all changes for public access have been implemented correctly.

## Code Changes Verification

### 1. Middleware
- [ ] [middleware.ts](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/middleware.ts) no longer enforces authentication

### 2. Dashboard Pages
- [ ] [app/dashboard/page.tsx](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/app/dashboard/page.tsx) shows all cases instead of user-specific cases
- [ ] [app/dashboard/cases/page.tsx](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/app/dashboard/cases/page.tsx) removed user authentication checks

### 3. API Routes
- [ ] [app/api/upload-cases/route.ts](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/app/api/upload-cases/route.ts) allows public uploads
- [ ] [app/api/cases/route.ts](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/app/api/cases/route.ts) allows public access to cases data
- [ ] [app/api/send-notification/route.ts](file:///Users/shriram/Downloads/onehealth-grid/app/api/send-notification/route.ts) uses alerts table correctly

## Database Changes Verification

### Option 1: RLS Disabled
- [ ] Run the SQL commands to disable RLS on all tables:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE disease_cases DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE outbreaks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE alerts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE user_roles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE notification_preferences DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE analytics_snapshots DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ```

### Option 2: Permissive Policies
- [ ] Create permissive policies for public access

## Functional Testing

### 1. Public Access
- [ ] Access the homepage without logging in
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard pages without authentication
- [ ] View disease cases, outbreaks, and alerts

### 2. Data Operations
- [ ] Upload a CSV file without logging in
- [ ] Create new cases through the UI
- [ ] Update case statuses
- [ ] View analytics and reports

### 3. API Access
- [ ] Access API endpoints without authentication headers
- [ ] Retrieve cases data via API
- [ ] Create new cases via API

## Security Check

⚠️ **Important**: Ensure that these changes are only implemented in development or demonstration environments. Verify that:

- [ ] The system is not accessible from the public internet in production
- [ ] Database backups have been created before implementing changes
- [ ] Proper authentication will be restored before moving to production
